    <h2> Birth</h2>
  </center>
  <p> I was born on October 29, 2003, in Pensacola Florida. I spent only 2-3 years of my life in Florida until we moved to Madison, Alabama, later.

    <h2> Early Childhood</h2>
  </center>
  <p> After moving to Madison, I vaguely remember any event that took place then except my first time riding a bike which was with training wheels. Two years later, we moved to Ardmore and made a living there almost three years. It was a nice and chill time
    in Ardmore. I got homeschooled during my Pre-K year. </p>
